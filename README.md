# Wireworld
[Wireworld](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wireworld) is a cellular automaton which is well suited for simulating logic gates.

Each cell can be in one of four states:
1. empty
2. conductor   
3. electron head
4. electron tail

The simulation proceeds in discrete steps. Each step changes the cells in the following ways:
- empty &rarr; empty
- electron head &rarr; electron tail
- electron tail &rarr; conductor
- conductor &rarr; Electron head if one or two neighboring cells are electron heads, else it remains a conductor. A cell neighbors another if it is orthogonally or diagonally adjacent ([Moore neighborhood](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moore_neighborhood)).

Run wireworld.py to start it. Requires Python 3 and PyGame 2.
```
python wireworld.py
```

### Examples
An AND gate. Conductor cells are orange, electron heads are blue and electron tails are red. The inputs are on the left, the output is to the right.

A half adder. Left are the two inputs. Top right is the ones output and bottom right is the twos output.
